 },
 {
   "Question": "Is there any limit to the number of nodes that I can enter?",
   "Response": "There is no limit to the number of nodes you can create at each level. You can add nodes as needed."
 },
 {
   "Question": "Here, you mean at each level. Is there an upper limit on the total levels of nodes? ",
   "Response": "Yes, you are right! So far, our context tree only supports 3 levels. When designing the context tree, be careful to the level restriction.\n"
 },
 {
   "Question": "Hi, I cannot add a child node to the 4th level of the context tree. How can I fix this?",

   "Response": "There is no limit to the number of nodes and child nodes, but tree should have only three levels."
 },
 {
   "Question": "Got it! Will too many nodes affect efficiency?",
   "Response": "Great question! The greater the number of nodes, the more test cases will be generated and the longer it will take. So if possible create a tree with necessary key values.\n"
 },
 {
   "Question": "How can I organize the context features? Can you provide a template?",
   "Response": "You can organize your context features into a tree structure level by level. A parent node presents a context feature, and a child node presents a subfeature of that context feature."
 },
 {
   "Question": "How many subfeatures can I add to a context feature?",

 },
 {
   "Question": "Does the order of nodes at each level matter?",
   "Response": "The order of nodes at each level will be automatically sorted based on name (A-Z) after each action. The order doesn't affect test cases generation."
 },
 {
   "Question": "If I add more than 10 nodes at a level, would it be too much?",
   "Response": "Actually, there is no restrictions. However, more nodes will take more time to generate test cases and modeling inputs.\n"

   "Question": "2. Click and hold to move tree around.",
   "Response": "3. Double click near the tree to zoom-in.\n"
 },
 {
   "Question": "Can I specify the file save path in advance instead of selecting it every time?",
   "Response": "No, we don't have that option. We utilize systems file explorer. But once user opens the directory and selects a file, the same directory will open during the user session."
 },
 {
   "Question": "If I switch to other app and come back, the same directory still open?",
   "Response": "Not exactly. The same directory stays open only if you only use this app.\n"
 },
 {
   "Question": "I’d like to turn a sub-feature into a higher level feature, and how can I make this modification?",

 },
 {
   "Question": "Over 100 nodes.",
   "Response": "The more nodes, the more test cases will be generated. It will take a looooong time. So if possible delete some redundant nodes and just retain the key ones.\n"
 },
 {
   "Question": "It took me a long time to generate all the test cases. Is there a problem with too many nodes in my context tree?",
